The properties of this package find their roots in the design philosophy of [Bootstrap alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/). By leveraging the visual and functional elements that Bootstrap provides, I've ensured that this package inherits a familiar and intuitive user interface.
